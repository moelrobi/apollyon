# New simple Musicbot

Hence the banning of Discord-Bots like Groovy and Rythm i am now opensourcing this simple bot which implements Slash-Commands to play music.

Please note that a manual setup of this project is not yet supported as the commands are still in need of manual deployment.

See [Discord.JS-Wiki](https://discordjs.guide/) for seeing how to implement Slash-Commands.
